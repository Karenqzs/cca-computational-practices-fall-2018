### Homework 1 (due Friday, September 14, 2018)

THis homework has two parts. First, follow up on our in-class work. Second, prepare for our next class session by watching a few videos and answering some questions.

You will be submitting each homework assignment into a new GitHub repository each week. [Here are instructions on how to do so.](https://github.com/zamfi/github-guide/blob/master/README.md) Please [email me](mailto:zamfi@cca.edu) if you have any questions!

#### Getting ready to program

1.  You'll need a program that edits plain text. Here are a few options:
    - [Atom](https://atom.io)
    - [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com)
    - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
    - [TextMate](https://macromates.com) (Mac only, and old)

2.  You'll need a web browser that displays content consistently: [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). Download Chrome and install it, if you don't already have it of course!

3.  Download the [HTML file](index.html) printout we looked at in class, and open it with your selected code editor. Also open that file with the Chrome browser -- you should see the same bubbles we saw in calss.

4.  Explore the javascript code inside `index.html`. Figure out which numbers you can change to:

    - Make the bubbles tiny or huge.
    - Make the bubbles' motions more vigorous.
    - Change the bubbles' colors.

    You are running an experiment when you do the above. It helps to keep track of what changes to the code you've tried, and what effect each of those changes had. Take advantage of your code editor's **undo** and **revert** functionality.
    
    On paper, keep a table of which numbers you've changed (how do you even identify them? perhaps by line number?) and what effect that change had. See if you can figure out a theory for what effect each number has.
    
    **Challenge**: Modify the code so that it adds more bubbles if you click *outside* of any existing bubble.
    
    **Assignment: upload each of your modifications in its own file to a new GitHub repository ([instructions here](https://github.com/zamfi/github-guide/blob/master/README.md)) for this homework assignment, called `hw1`. Email me a link to your repository at [zamfi@cca.edu](mailto:zamfi@cca.edu).**

5.  In class, we talked about how a CPU runs through instructions linearly performing calculations. Think about whether you have ever performed a task like this in your life. What was it?
    
    **Assignment**: Include a brief description in your homework repository's README.md file.
    

#### Learning about P5.js

Watch the following videos by Daniel Shiffman: [1.3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3TeLi6Ns1E&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA&index=3), [1.4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riiJTF5-N7c&index=4&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA), [1.5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuGsp5KeJMM&index=5&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA), and [1.6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJcrPJuem5Q&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA&index=6). (You are free to watch 1.1 and 1.2 as well, which introduce p5.js and the web editor, but you are not required to.)

Answer the following questions in a `questions.md` file in your repository:

1. What do the numbers inside the parentheses after a function name do?
2. What’s the different between `fill` and `stroke`?
3. The p5 web editor has a built-in console — but it turns out that Chrome also has a console to display errors. Do some googling to find out how you can open the Chrome console. Then, try to find a website that has errors — visit a website, open the console, and see if there are any red-highlighted items. Take a screenshot and upload it into your repository!
4. What is the keyboard shortcut to open the JavaScript console in Chrome?
